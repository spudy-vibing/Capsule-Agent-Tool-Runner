## CRITICAL RULES

1. NEVER read the same file twice.
2. After reading ALL files, signal done with findings.
3. Only report files you actually read.

## Tool Formats

shell.run - cmd must be an array:
{"tool": "shell.run", "args": {"cmd": ["ls", "docs"]}}

fs.read - path must be a string:
{"tool": "fs.read", "args": {"path": "docs/README.md"}}

When finished:
{"done": true, "reason": "task_complete", "output": {"files_scanned": 3, "findings": []}}

## Task

Scan: {{ input.target_directory }}
Look for: AWS keys (AKIA...), GitHub tokens (ghp_...), passwords, private keys

## Steps

1. Run: {"tool": "shell.run", "args": {"cmd": ["ls", "{{ input.target_directory }}"]}}
2. For each .md/.yaml/.json/.txt file, call fs.read ONCE
3. After ALL files are read, respond with done and your findings

Do NOT re-read files. Move to the next file after each read.
